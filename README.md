# Lyra

Open-Source DMX control software

**This software is in development and probably won't work properly yet**

## Installation

<span style="color:red">ðŸš¨ **The build script currently doesn't work due to a new Lyra backend. This means you can't really compile a working executable yet. I'll update the script in the future.** ðŸš¨</span>

## Currently supported devices

1. The project uses the FX5 DMX interface library and therefore requires a FX5 DMX interface.

2. There are not many DMX lights available yet. More will be added in the future.

## License

The project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE)
